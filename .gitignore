# .gitignore – lists files & folders Git should NOT track so the repo stays clean and light.
# Every pattern below is explained in plain English so even non-developers can see why it matters.

# 1) Node.js dependencies – this folder can be recreated at any time with `npm install`.
node_modules/

# 2) Python virtual-environment – large compiled packages; rebuilt with `python -m venv`.
venv/
*.egg-info/

# 3) Operating-system clutter – files macOS drops automatically.
.DS_Store

# 4) Python bytecode & caches – auto-generated when scripts run; not source.
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]

# 5) Test & coverage artefacts – produced by pytest or coverage tools.
.pytest_cache/
coverage/
htmlcov/

# 6) Editor / IDE metadata – keeps personal settings out of the repo.
.vscode/
.idea/

# 7) Cursor & other AI assistant working dirs – local only, not useful for others.
# By default ignore AI assistant scratch directory, **but** keep the rules files versioned.
.cursor/*
!.cursor/rules/
!.cursor/rules/implementation.mdc

# 8) Environment variable files – contain secrets that should never leave your machine.
.env
.env.*

# 9) Logs – transient debug output.
*.log

# 10) Build artefacts – created by bundlers or compilers.
dist/
build/

# 11) Cypress artefacts – local test recordings.
cypress/videos/
cypress/screenshots/

# 12) Yarn & pnpm lock files if not in use – uncomment the one you don't need.
# yarn.lock
# pnpm-lock.yaml
