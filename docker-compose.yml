  # Neo4j database dedicated to the automated test suite.
  # -----------------------------------------------------
  # We expose the Bolt port (7687) so the Node.js test runner
  # can connect via the official neo4j-driver. The HTTP port (7474)
  # is also published purely for developer convenience – you can
  # visit http://localhost:7474 in your browser to visually inspect
  # the graph while debugging a failing CI run.
