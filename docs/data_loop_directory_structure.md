- Each "app" (Node backend, React frontend, Python AI) lives in its own folder so you and your dev can work without stepping on each other's toes.
- The "contracts" folder is your shared handshake: it's how you both agree on what data to send/receive, so you don't need to read each other's code.
- "libs" are helpers, but only for their own language.
- "infra" is the glue that lets you run everything together easily.
- "docs" is where all your planning and specs live.

This setup keeps things organized, easy to grow, and lets each person focus on what they do best.
